At DATASCIENCEGT, we are the swiss-army-knife of data, its lifecycle, and business use through AI and ML. We have done it all and used a lengthy list of technology tools and cloud services in AWS, Azure and GCP to do these things.

Major areas of our exertise, experience and value:

Data and Business Value Creation - talk here about how we focus like a laser on taking data and turning it into business value, and keeping it ongoing. Blah blah blah.

Data Architecture and Platform Engineering - We can take any data system that is currently in place and help architect, design, engineer and implement a platform that is amenable to sustainable business value and AI development...cloud based...blah blah blah.

Data Analytics and Visualizations - Standard stuff <> We can build dashboards that are living, breathing and ongoing. We can dive deep to develop keen insights and non-intuitive decision metrics...blah blah blah

Data Engineering - We design, develop and deploy automated end-to-end pipelines to keep the data from any source flowing into an data science / AI-ready platform for continuous business value delivery and consistency. blah blah blah

AI and ML Modeling and Operationalization - We help build AI and machine learning models, validate the models and operationalize them in production-grade form for continuous retraining, validation and downstream business use....blah blah blah.
