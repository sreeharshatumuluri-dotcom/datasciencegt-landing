We prioritize fast value creation by eliminating friction from the business process. We've established a set of rules to ensure a comfortable ride with us, providing a seamless path to success.Â  Here is how we work!

Zero-Risk Project Definition
We offer a free 30-minute initial consultation. Should you decide to move forward, we'll invest further time at no cost to fully define and scope the project and get to signing the contract.

Confidentiality & Compliance
We sign your NDA and MS documents consisting of industry-standard and reasonable custom terms, without any questions asked. We employ zero tolerance for violations of confidentiality and data privacy by anyone at DATASCIENCEGT. This comes naturally to us after working for highly-regulated finance, healthcare, and social media FTC-regulated companies.

Project-Based Pricing
Your cost is certain. We price projects, not hours, so you know the full cost up front and never have to watch the clock.

No Prepayment Required
We trust our work. You pay when we start delivering, not before. Project milestones and payment-term timelines will be negotiated in good faith and to mutual satisfaction.

Flexible Payment Terms
We offer NET 45 payment terms for any accrued fees, giving you peace of mind and sufficient time to process invoices.

Easy Procurement
We can sign directly with you or subcontract under your preferred vendor, easing the burden on you.

Knowledge Transfer
We don't deliver a solution that locks you in with DATASCIENCEGT. We actively train, mentor, and groom your own team through our work so they can confidently carry the torch forward. WE aim to add further value through new scope projects.
