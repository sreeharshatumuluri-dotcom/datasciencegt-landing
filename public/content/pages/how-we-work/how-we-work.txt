We prioritize fast value creation by eliminating friction from the process of doing business together. We've built a set of rules so you have a comfortable ride with us, ensuring a seamless path to success.
Here is how we work!

Zero-Risk Project Definition
We offer a free 30-minute initial consultation. Should you decide to move forward, we'll invest further time at no cost to fully define and scope the project.

Confidentiality & Compliance
We sign your standard NDA and MSA terms. We employ zero tolerance for violations of confidentiality and data privacy by anyone at DATASCIENCEGT.

Project-Based Pricing
Your cost is certain. We price projects, not hours, so you know the full cost up front and never have to watch the clock.

No Prepayment Required
We trust our work. You pay when we start delivering, not before. Payment terms and timelines will be worked out to your satisfaction.

Flexible Payment Terms
We offer NET 45 payment terms for any accrued fees, giving you peace of mind and sufficient time to process invoices.

Easy Procurement
We can come as a subcontractor to your preferred vendor, easing the burden of engaging a new partner. We sign your MSA as long as the terms are industry-standard.

Knowledge Transfer
We don't just deliver a solution. We actively train, mentor, and groom your own team through our work so they can confidently carry the torch forward.
